# my-ava
Source code for my-ava.net's bot creation and maintennance methods.
Run main.py for a standalone barebones demo (fill in keys and tokens in env).
For avatar display, voice chat, and standard type bots, you will need your own frontend (see processing.py).
All bot types are ready to go out of the box in barebones config (text only).
For a demo and free frontend try my-ava.net.
Easy to plug in alternative LLMs, just replace chatbot.ask() in chatbot.py
