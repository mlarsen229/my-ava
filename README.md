# my-ava
Source code for my-ava.net's bot creation and maintennance methods.
Run create_config() located in app.py inserting your own config data.
For avatar display, voice chat, and standard type bots, you will need your own frontend (see processing.py).
Twitch and Discord type bots are ready to go out of the box.
For a demo and free frontend try my-ava.net.
Easy to plug in alternative LLMs, just replace chatbot.ask() in chatbot.py
